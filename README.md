# Data-driven characterization of plates

Matlab<sup>TM</sup> and Comsol Multiphysics <sup>TM</sup> implementation of a neural network based inverse method to estimate the material properties of thin plates of spruce tonewood. The method is called *FRF2Params* as it is necessary to measure a Frequency Response Function (FRF) at prescribed points of the plate surface to estimate the plate material parameters (Params).

This repository contains all the measurements and data related to the article *"A neural network-based method for spruce tonewood characterization", Journal of Acoustic Society of America (JASA)*
