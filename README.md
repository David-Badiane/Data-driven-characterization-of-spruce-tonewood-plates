# Data-driven characterization of plates
This repository contains all the measurements, data and code related to the article *"A neural network-based method for spruce tonewood characterization", Journal of Acoustic Society of America (JASA)* , which presents a neural network based inverse method to estimate the material properties of thin plates of spruce tonewood.

The methodology presented in this repo is called *FRF2Params* as it is necessary to measure a Frequency Response Function (FRF) at prescribed points of the plate surface to estimate the plate material parameters (Params).
