# Data-driven characterization of plates
This repository contains all the measurements, data and code related to the article *"A neural network-based method for spruce tonewood characterization", Journal of Acoustic Society of America (JASA)* (David Giuseppe Badiane, Raffaele Malvermi, Sebastian Gonzalez, Fabio Antonacci, Augusto Sarti), which presents a neural network based inverse method to estimate the material properties of thin plates of spruce tonewood. 


# Introduction

  <img align="right" src="/Figures/wood_directions.png" width="250"> The methodology contained in this repository is called *FRF2Params*, as it is necessary to measure a Frequency Response Function (FRF) at prescribed points of a wooden plate surface (along with the plate geometry and density) to estimate the material parameters of the plate (Params). 

Our focus is set on musical acoustic and instrument making, so we devised the method to indentify the material properties of thin rectangular plates of spruce tonewood used to build the soundboards of guitars. The figure beside shows how those plates are used to build the soundboards. As it can be seen, the soundboard is carved from two thin plates cut from the same piece of spruce glued together.
