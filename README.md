# Data-driven-characterization-of-plates

Matlab<sup>TM</sup> and Comsol Multiphysics <sup>TM</sup> implementation of a neural network based method to estimate the material properties of thin plates of spruce tonewood from a single Frequency Response Function (FRF) evaluated at prescribed points of its surface.
The method is called *FRF2Params*. The repository contains also all the measurments and data related to the article *"A neural network-based method for spruce tonewood characterization", Journal of Acoustic Society of America (JASA)*
